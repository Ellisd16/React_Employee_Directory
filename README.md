## About
  I was tasked with creating an application that would allow the user to see all of the current employees on a webpage. The page was required to be dynamic, changing the viewport whenever the user typed in the search bar. The page was also required to have a way to sort the array of employees, which I chose to do so by job. For this app, I used React to allow for state change, and I create the app through the use of components.

## Languages and Programs
* Languages
  * Javascipt
  * React

## Challenges
Learning how to manipulate state through different levels of components proved to be somewhat difficult, but I was able to get the app fully functional.

## Future Developments 
I want to make it so that if you delete what you had in the search bar, it will revert back to the intial state of the page. Also, creating a server so that I can deploy this to Heroku would be sweet!
